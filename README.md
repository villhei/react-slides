# React slideshow component `react-slides`

This is a wip library project that exposes a small library for displaying aspect ratio locked slideshows.

See [Online Demo](https://villhei.github.io/react-slides/)

## Features

The library provides a component that you can wrap into a div of any size and it will scale your slides to that div. When focused/selected or in fullscreen, the Slideshow component will handle `ARROW_LEFT` and `ARROW_RIGHT` keyup events to call the nextSlide callback.

## How to use

See [Examples](/examples/basic/)

## Running in development

```
yarn
yarn start:dev
```
